1.1. Purpose

The purpose of our project is to improve and expedite the process of searching for files on your computer. In general the software is for anyone who has ever had a difficult time locating a specific file they need to find quickly within their file manager. Our client specifically is an insurance company and they need the application to be able to quickly locate important medical and financial documents of varying filetype. Customer service representatives will especially benefit from the application because it will both simplify the search process and reduce the amount of time they need to keep a customer on hold, therefore, improving the mood of the customer and decreasing frustrations for the employee.
