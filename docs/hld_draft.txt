1. Introduction

===
1.1. Purpose

The purpose of our project is to improve and expedite the process of searching for files on your computer. In general, the software is for anyone who has ever had a difficult time locating a specific file within their within their file manager, that they need to find quickly. Our client is an insurance company and they need the application to be able to quickly locate important medical and financial documents of varying filetype. Customer service representatives especially will benefit from the application because it will both simplify the search process, and reduce the amount of time they need to keep a customer on hold, therefore, improving the mood of the customer and decreasing frustrations for the employee.

2. Design Summary

===
2.1. Overview of Design

Our design for this project is based around a main class that will manage the interactions between our GUI class, User class, and our database. Our GUI class will instantiate objects that allow the user to view information about their file hierarchy, tags, and the history of the actions that they have performed. The GUI is also where the user will interact with these areas to select files and either add tags to them or remove tags from them, create and delete tags, and search for files based upon their given tags. There will be a centrally located search bar in the GUI to facilitate the searching of files by their tags. To access the application the user will need to login through the GUI with a username and password that will be stored in the database. There will be three different levels of users based upon subclasses where the increased level of user indicates increased privleges and gives them access to more methods that they can execute. A basic user has a username and password and can add and remove tags from files, as well as, search for files based upon their tags. The next level of user inherits the previous methods and properties but they are also able to create new tags for use and delete tags from existence. The highest level of user again inherits the previous methods and properties but can create new users, delete users, promote users to the next level, and demote users down a level. The GUI will also communicate through an external interface with the computers file manager so that the file hierarchy can be viewed and navigated through withinin the GUI. There will also be a DBhelper class that reformats incoming and outgoing data so that it will correctly interact with both the database and our programming language. All data will be transferred through an HTTPS server for security purposes and the server will be set up with a Server class.

2.3. Tools 

Slack version four is used as TEAM’s primary communication tool. On Slack, group members post updates to their current assignments, ask questions that they may need help with and discuss plans for future requirement deadlines. TEAM uses Slack to hold bi-weekly meetings, which are scheduled and documented on GitHub.

TEAM uses Slack for collaboration and discussion of critical areas of the project. Dedicated channels  are set up for discussion, including an LLD channel, an HLD, an SRS channel and a meetings channel. Each channel is intended for use by the team member who has the responsibility of that respective role. Group discussions are held on the subject given and the group collaborate to find solutions to problems as they arise. 

The other collaboration tool that TEAM is using, is a popular version control system named GitHub. It is used to make commits to files, merge and upload files based on the project requirements. Files are saved plain text using the extension of .txt following the Uniform English Writing Style Guide (UEWSG) format.

Each group member has posted their prefered work hours in the availability.txt document on GitHub, based on which meeting times of 8PM every Tuesday and Thursday were decided. The members of TEAM have tasks and other assignments that are listed individually in our master branch in the readme document. The readme document contains the weekly assignments and are only to be modified by the Project Manager or the Documentation Specialist. 

TEAM will be using PyCharm Version 2020.1.2 with the Build number 201.7846.77 as its Integrated Development Environment (IDE), this is a tool developed by JetBrains. The responsibilities of this IDE are to integrate with SQLite, which is the group's chosen database language and is primarily based on Python. The IDE will be used to develop the application when the SDLC is at the development phase and to implement testing procedures within that tool.

3. Design Details

===
3.1. Security

Being that our client is dealing with docments and records that by law need to remain confidential due to HIPAA laws we will be handling all transfers of data with an HTTPS server. This would stop potential hackers from being able to understand any data that they were able to intercept during a transfer to the database through the use of encryption. The company network is also local and will not be connected to the internet therefore forcing hackers to have a way to directly access the network. The physical security of the building will provide further protection and deny unauthorized personnel any way of directly accessing the network or server.

===
3.2. Hardware

The hardware that will be required for this project will include the following. A server for the database to be stored on. A network to provide the comunication of data between the employee's computers, which will host the GUI, and the database. Cables and routers will also be neccesary both to connect the employee's computers to the database server and for the construction of the network as the entire LAN will be hardwired to increase security. Our application will be able to run on any basic computer or laptop that is provided for the employees.

===
3.3. User Interfaces

The GUI will be a window that appears in the middle of the screen and can be resized and dragged to where the user wants it. A login screen will be the first to appear where the employee can input their username and password to get into the application. After logging in there will be a screen with three separated areas. On one side will be a panel where the user employee can navigate their file tree and select a folder or file that that want to add or remove tags from. There will also be a checkable option that allows the tags that are added/removed to be inhereted by the subfolders and files beneath it. On the other side of the screen there will be a panel that has all of the available tags that can be used as well as a search bar to search for a specific tag that the employee wants to use. If the employee has the correct permissions this is also where they will be able to delete tags from the database, as well as, create new tags for use. In the middle of the screen there will be a search bar where the employee will be able to search for files by entering the associated tags and this is where the returned files will be displayed. There will also be a button where the user can display their personal history of what actions they have recently performed. Clicking on this button will bring up a new panel and will display these archived actions in two columns. The first column will have what action the user performed, whether it be adding a tag to a file, deleting a tag, or searching for a file by its tags. The second column will have the what object the action took place upon. Whether it be the filename that was returned by the search or show the tag that was created/deleted.

3.4. Internal Interfaces

There will be a few internal interfaces at work for our project due to several classes needing to pass data back and forth between eachother. The GUI will be interfacing with the tags class in order to retrieve the list of created tags and add them to the display for the user to see. The GUI will also interface with the history class which will all the GUI to retrieve a list of the users recent actions and display them to the user. The main class will be interfacing with both the user and GUI class to manage their interactions through the users choices and actions in the GUI.

===
3.5. External Interfaces

There will be two external interfaces involved in the creation of this project. The first external interface that will be needed is one to communicate with the computers base file manager in order to pull the file hierarchy for the computer into our application. The file hierarchy after being pulled will still maintain full functionality and navigational ability while being displayed witing the GUI. The second external interface that the project will include is for communicating with our SQLite database. It will be responsible for reformatting transfer requests on both ends so that both the database and our program can understand and utilize the information.

===
3.6. Architecture

The architecture being used for this project is a client/server model. Our client will have many differnent instances of the GUI open on different employee computers. All of these separate instances will be simultaneously communicating over the established company network and routed into the database using an HTTPS server that we will have set up. This architeture will support constant updates of the GUI based on any changes made to the data on the server side that were created by another user and instance of the program. This is so all of the information remains constant and reliable for the employees who need to use it.

3.7. Reports

Some of the reports that will be available with the application on release will include most used tags, most searched tags, most searched files, number of searches by user for a certain time period.

===
3.8. Other Output

===
3.9. Databases

This project only requires the use of one RDBMS for the storage and management of user identification parameters, group permissions, filename and tag relations, and user histories. SQLite works well for the client because it is a robust and lightweight system that boasts speedy query times which will be important for the customer service representatives who are trying to search for files in the most efficient manner possible. SQLite also offers high portability and will work across a wide variety of operating systems allowing the company to utilize any equipment they already have available and not worry about having to standardize everything for compatibility with our application. One final benefit of SQLite is that content can be updated continously and automatically so that in the event of a power outage or crash little to no data will be lost.

3.10. Top-Level Classes (Class Hierarchy)

• Main class - This will call the GUI class and handle all interaction between the user inputs and the GUI.

• GUI class - This will be class that contains and displays all of our other objects.

• User class - This class contains the username and password parameters and will contain the methods for the user to interact with the GUI. This class will also have two subclasses representing the level of employee and the subclasses will have additional methods for interacting with the GUI and the highest level user will be able to create other users and manage their privleges.

• Tags class - This will be responsible for holding all of the created tags and displaying them for the user.

• Server class - This will be for setting up our server and defining the requests for sending and retrieving data.

• DBhelper class - This will be for reformatting the data from python to SQL so when it is sent it can correctly interact with our database tables

• History class - This will hold a list of the users recent actions. Some examples would be creating a tag, adding a tag to a file, and searching for a file by its tags.

• FileMangagerHelper class - This will be responsible for retrieveing the computers file hierarchy from the file manager for display in the GUI
